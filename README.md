# Molecular classification of cancer by gene expression monitoring

This is my attempt at using the Kaggle [1999 Golub et al. dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/gene-expression) to do some classification on cancer cases based on gene expression monitoring. 

I attempt to classify cancer patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
